<h1>Background on the Swift parrot</h1>
<p>The swift parrot, known to the scientific community as the Lathamus discolor, is a small fast-flying bird with pointed wings and a long pointed tail. Its body is mostly bright green with a dark blue patch on the crown (Higgins 1999). Swift parrots live in trees and eat mainly nectar, flowers, lerps, seeds, and some psyllids. The parrot was originally described by John White in 1790 as the red-shouldered paroquet and given the taxa, Psittacus discolor. However, in 1830 it was placed in the genus Lathamus by René Primevère  (Atlas of Living Australia). It is the only member in its genus and is not closely related to migratory parrots like the blue-winged and orange-bellied parrots (Atlas of Living Australia). Currently, Lathamus discolor is only found in south-eastern Australia. Between the months of September and March, all birds can be found breeding in Tasmania. However, during the winter, they migrate to Victorica or New South Wales (Birds in Backyard). During the mating season, they make their nest in the Tasmanian Blue Gum tree and often return to the same nest each year. The species is rapidly declining due to nest predation by the introduced Sugar Glider Petaurus breviceps and the loss of the blue gum tree. According to a research paper by Dejan Stojanovic, 83% of swift parrot nest failed due to predation. It was later reported in the Elsevier scientific journal that in most cases, about 80% of sugar glider predation at nests, also resulted in the death of the adult female parrot and the loss of her eggs (Heinsohn 2015). There were estimated to be fewer than 2000 mature individuals remaining in the wild as of 2011, and researchers from the Australian National University estimate that the species may face extinction by 2031(Atlas of Living Australia). They are currently classified as Critically Endangered (BirdLife Data Zone).</p>
<h1>Behavior of swift parrot</h1>
<p><h3>Swift Parrots breed only in Tasmania and then fly across Bass Strait to forage on the flowering eucalypts in open box–ironbark forests of the Australian mainland. While on the mainland, they are nomadic, spending weeks or months at some sites and only a few hours at others, determined by the supply of nectar. They roost communally, often in the same tree each night. They are almost always in trees, coming to the ground only to drink.</h3></p>
